            <p>There's a lot of stuff in it, with a very strong taste, for those who do not want to deprive themselves of anything: tomato sauce, mozzarella, ham, mushrooms, dark olives, artichokes and boiled eggs. What else? </p>

            <p id="subtitle3">PINEAPPLE PIZZA</p>
            <p>It simply doesn't exist. Some fool made up this thing and now some other fool says it's good. It isn't. Please, don't eat it, don't do it. Every time you ask for that an italian dies. Please, we're funny people. Don't let us extinguish.</p>
